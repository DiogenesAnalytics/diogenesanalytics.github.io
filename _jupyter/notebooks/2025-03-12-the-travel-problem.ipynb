    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this article we will discuss a very common *decision problem*: how best to travel from a starting point `A` to some target destination `Z` in the *\"best\"* manner possible. Of course, as we previously discussed in the [last article](https://diogenesanalytics.com/blog/2025/02/26/reasoning-about-utility), it is the *utility* that must be defined in order to *quantitatively* define what is best. The majority of the article will present the *mathematical* definition of the utility function $U(x)$ for the *travel problem*, as well as the reasoning behind the definition, and finally a simple application."

    "## Reasoning About Travel Utility\n",
    "To understand how we arrived at such an equation, we must ask ourselves a simple question: what is the purpose of travel? Simply put, *travel* is about getting from one point to another. That could be called the *\"reward\"* or *\"benefit.\"* But the cost of said travel does not include just money $M$, but also time $T$, and even something more abstract, which is stress $S$.\n",
    "So we can think about the *\"utility\"* of such a problem as simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "U(x) = \\frac{\\text{What You Want}}{\\text{What It Costs}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we want to travel some distance $D$ between two points, but we will be forced to pay some cost term that includes *money* $M$, *time* $T$, and stress $S$:\n",
    "\n",
