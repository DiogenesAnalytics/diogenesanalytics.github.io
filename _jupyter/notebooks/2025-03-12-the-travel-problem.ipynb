    "In this article we will discuss a very common *decision problem*: how best to travel from a starting point `A` to some target destination `Z` in the *\"best\"* manner possible. Of course, as we previously discussed in the [last article](https://diogenesanalytics.com/blog/2025/02/26/reasoning-about-utility), it is the *utility* that must be defined in order to *quantitatively* define what is best. The majority of the article will present the *mathematical* definition of the utility function $U(x)$ for the *travel problem*, as well as the reasoning behind the definition, and finally a simple application."
