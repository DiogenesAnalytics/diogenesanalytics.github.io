    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this article we will discuss a very common *decision problem*: how best to travel from a starting point `A` to some target destination `Z` in the *\"best\"* manner possible. Of course, as we previously discussed in the [last article](https://diogenesanalytics.com/blog/2025/02/26/reasoning-about-utility), it is the *utility* that must be defined in order to *quantitatively* define what is best. The majority of the article will present the *mathematical* definition of the utility function $U(x)$ for the *travel problem*, as well as the reasoning behind the definition, and finally a simple application."

That could be called the *\"reward\"* or *\"benefit.\"* But the cost of said travel does not include just money $M$, but also time $T$, and even something more abstract, which is stress $S$.\n",

    "But one aspect of the *mathematics of stress* we have not discussed is what *influences* the *growth rate* $k$? For our purposes, let us consider some *\"travel examples\"* in an attempt to reason about what causes *\"stress\"* in travel. Consider the following two scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 1**: Empty Train\n",
    "- You board a **nearly empty** train car.  \n",
    "- There is **ample seating**, personal space, and no loud distractions.  \n",
    "- No one is **blocking the aisles**, slowing you down, or invading your personal space.  \n",
    "- The ride is **quiet**, predictable, and uninterrupted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 2**: Packed Subway\n",
    "- You board a **rush-hour subway**, standing shoulder to shoulder with strangers.  \n",
    "- Noise levels are high: **announcements, conversations, crying babies**.  \n",
    "- The **air is stuffy**, and you’re forced to hold onto a metal bar with limited mobility.  \n",
    "- At each stop, **more people cram in**, pushing against you.  \n",
    "- The train **suddenly stops** due to delays, adding uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different ways we can *\"describe\"* what is the difference between the two scenarios: *noise*, *threat*, *attack*, *interruption*, *diversion*, *chaos*, *distraction*, etc ... But ultimately one word encapsulates the difference: **stimulation**. The difference between the *two scenarios* is that **scenario 1** is less stimulating. And why? There is less *stimulation* from the environment: less people, less noise, less distractions, and less interruptions. Whereas **scenario 2** is **total chaos**.\n",
