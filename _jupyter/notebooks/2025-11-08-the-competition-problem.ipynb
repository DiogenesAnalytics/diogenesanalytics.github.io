    "## Introduction\n",
    "We talk about competition as if it were obvious. A company “wins” by making more money. A species “wins” by reproducing more. A trader “wins” by earning higher returns. But this idea hides something important: winning only exists relative to someone else.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run the fastest race of your life but no one else is on the track, you did not win anything. If every investor makes the same trade, there is no [advantage](https://diogenesanalytics.com/blog/2025/04/20/defining-advantage). Competition is never about absolute performance. It is defined by the distribution of outcomes across the entire field of players. Winning is a relational property.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to the first big insight:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Competitive advantage is never absolute. It only exists when few others can achieve the same result.\n",
    "\n",
    "A cheetah is not fast because it reaches some magical speed threshold. It is fast because few other animals do. A successful business move is not valuable because it is universally optimal. It is valuable because others failed to take it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Competition is the search for rare states that combine two properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. they are highly advantageous, and\n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "2. they are difficult for others to reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this creates a paradox at the heart of all competition. The moment an advantage is noticed, copied, or learned, it stops being an advantage. When many players attempt the same strategy, the rare becomes common and the valuable becomes ordinary. Competition destroys itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet the story does not end there. The erosion of one advantage sets the stage for another. As players pile onto the same peak, the landscape shifts. The old opportunity collapses, but a new one emerges. Competition is not a race to a fixed finish line — it is a dynamic system that constantly redistributes advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article develops that idea fully. We will show three things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Competition is governed by relative performance, not absolute performance.*\n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "2. *Relative advantage is conserved: for every winner, there must be losers.*\n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "3. *Competitive systems naturally evolve toward equilibrium — and then break equilibrium by creating new opportunities.*\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Competition is the process by which systems seek out rare, high-payoff states, destroy them by imitation, and then produce the next frontier of advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Economics, biology, strategy, and markets all follow this pattern. Solving the competition problem requires understanding this logic clearly enough to predict how advantage emerges, how it disappears, and what kinds of strategies survive these cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we do that, the solution becomes visible: the **optimal strategy** in any competitive system is not to find a single advantage and defend it forever, but to *position oneself where the next advantage will arise*.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is the full story we are going to tell."

    "## Absolute vs. Relative Fitness\n",
    "Every competitive system rests on a simple observation: performance has two different meanings depending on the context in which it is measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Absolute fitness** is a measure of capability.\n",
    "  It asks: *How strong is this agent by itself?*\n",
    "  <br><br>\n",
    "* **Relative fitness** measures standing in a population.\n",
    "  It asks: *How strong is this agent compared to others facing the same constraints?*\n",
    "\n",
    "If there were no rivals, no crowding, and no competition for limited outcomes, absolute fitness would determine success. The fastest runner wins the race. The most profitable strategy earns the highest return. The strongest organism survives.\n",
    "\n",
    "But real competitive environments rarely reward performance in isolation. They reward **differentials**. A cheetah that runs faster than its peers gains survival value not because its speed is objectively high, but because that level of speed is *rare*. A firm that anticipates a market shift profits only because others do not make the same move.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Competition amplifies difference, not magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why gains do not guarantee victory. Even if every agent improves equally, no one has advanced competitively. You do not win by becoming good—you win by becoming **better than the forces acting against you**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This shift in perspective reveals something profound. The outcomes of competitive systems cannot be understood purely from the properties of individual agents. They depend on the **distribution of states across the entire population**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is this population structure that makes competition adversarial. Improvements and advantages do not occur in a vacuum. When one agent moves ahead, others fall behind. When a strategy dominates, alternative strategies lose ground. Relative fitness is shaped not by the agent alone, but by all agents simultaneously attempting to optimize.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to a fundamental constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Success is always measured against a shared environment of rivals.\n",
    "\n",
    "And from this constraint emerges the first law of competitive systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Competitive advantage is always relative.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section we formalize this fact mathematically. We will show that relative fitness has a strict conservation property: the gains of one agent must come at the comparative expense of others. It is this conservation that creates adversaries, pushes systems away from static equilibria, and sets the stage for the deeper dynamics of competition."

    "## The Mathematics of Competitive Position\n",
    "We now formalize the ideas from the previous section. Relative fitness is not just a conceptual tool — it has precise mathematical structure that governs competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let each agent ($i$) have an **absolute fitness** ($f_i$). The **mean fitness** of a population of size ($N$) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar f = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N f_i\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r_i = \\frac{f_i}{\\bar f}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By construction, ($r_i > 1$) means the agent is performing above the population average, while ($r_i < 1$) indicates below-average performance. Importantly, what matters is **position**, not absolute capability. Even if every agent doubles their absolute fitness, the distribution of ($r_i$) remains unchanged, no one has advanced competitively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an agent with high absolute fitness moving across populations with different mean fitness (see **figure 1**). Even a strong agent can appear mediocre if the population is stronger overall."
