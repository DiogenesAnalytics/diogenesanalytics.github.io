    "## Introduction\n",
    "What does it mean to be *\"competitive\"* and what does it mean to **WIN**? At first glance, the answer seems obvious: to win is to achieve a higher outcome — more profit, fitness, or performance — \n",
    "than one's rivals. But this explanation is circular. The statement \"I have won because I achieved more\" presupposes a\n",
    "**metric of comparison**, a shared frame in which \"more\" can be evaluated. In other words, the very idea of competition is\n",
    "**relational**. It is meaningless to say that an agent \"wins\" in isolation; victory is always a function of a shared\n",
    "constraint space in which other agents operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to the first paradox of competition:\n",
    "\n",
    "> There is no such thing as an intrinsically competitive state — only a relatively improbable one.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be “competitive” is to occupy a position that **others do not**, and likely **cannot**. It is the rarity, not the absolute magnitude, of the state that confers advantage. A cheetah that runs slightly faster than its peers gains survival value not because of its absolute speed, but because speed in that range is statistically uncommon. A firm that anticipates a market turn gains profit not because the move was universally optimal, but because few others acted upon it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests a reframing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Competition is the **economy of relative improbability**.\n",
    "* To compete successfully is to momentarily inhabit a configuration that has both **advantage** and **scarcity** within a\n",
    "given system of constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet the moment an advantage is recognized, it begins to erode. Once the rare becomes common — once others learn, adapt, or imitate — competitiveness vanishes. Every competitive advantage, by virtue of being both valuable and visible to others, contains the seed of its own dissolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this article develops this logic formally. It will show that competition, far from being a primitive concept, emerges from the interdependence of agents’ fitness and the distribution of accessible states in a system. From this perspective, economics, evolution, and strategy are all instances of a deeper mathematical principle:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A system is competitive when its agents are mutually constrained to seek low-probability, high-fitness states that cannot be simultaneously occupied.\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows, we will formalize this definition, explore its implications, and show why every sufficiently successful act of competition ultimately tends toward its own equilibrium — the point at which no further relative fitness advantage is possible."
