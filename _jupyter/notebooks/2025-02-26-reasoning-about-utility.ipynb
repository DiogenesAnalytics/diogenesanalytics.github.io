    "## Introduction\n",
    "Quite often in [decision making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making) you encounter a problem that requires something like a [cost-benefit analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost%E2%80%93benefit_analysis) or comparison of the different options based on the [ROI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment). In this article we are going to explore a problem that requires such an approach, and we are going to see that the concept of [utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility) will be invaluable in determining the best option."

    "## Simple Utility Demonstrated\n",
    "While the concept of [utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility) can seem complicated at first, in practice it's quite simple: it's just a function that will output a value for each option in a given scenario.\n",

    "U(x_i) = f(r_i,C_i) = r_i - C_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $r_i$ and $C_i$ are the *additional revenue* and *cost*, respectively, for option $x_i$. This example is relatively easy to understand: the higher the $r_i$ and the lower the $C_i$ the more *utility* the option $x_i$ possesses. As simple as this may seem, it is already a **powerful** way to reason about different options.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, here we have different *revenue* values for four options:\n",

    "If our *utility function* only considered $r$ (i.e. $U(x_i) = f(r_i)$) we may assume that option $x_4$ was the best choice (because it has the highest $r$ value). But when we consider the *cost* $C_i$:\n",
    "\n",

    "Another fascinating way to reason about the *utility* of some additional revenue $r$ is to consider it's relation to the *cost of living* $L$.

    "## Financial Goal Utility\n",
    "Finally we arrive at our last example of *utility* which can be thought of as *\"financial goal\"* utility. The idea behind this *type* of utility is to measure some *additional* revenue with respect to some *financial goal*. Probably the most common *\"financial goal*\" that exemplifies this type of utility is **financial freedom**. For illustrating how this utility can be defined, the goal we will set is $F = \\textdollar1,000,000$ (which is an arbitrary number but serves as a decent *financial goal* for retirement). The simplest way to define the *utility* for such a goal is similar to the **relative wealth utility** defined above:\n",

Instead there is a much more interesting **nonlinear** way to define the utility:\n",

    "What *utility* ultimately does, is allow you to move beyond single terms, like *price* or *revenue*, to more complex quantities in order to evaluate which option is *\"best.\"* In the *\"concrete\"* example above, we are able to balance quantities for *revenue/price*, *costs*, and *time* to arrive at a far superior evaluation of each selling method's utility (i.e. value). And since the utility we calculate in the aforementioned example is technically a wage, this also allows us to directly compare how *\"competitive\"* this *\"wage\"* is to a target wage (e.g. the average wage, etc ...). Again, thanks to *utility* we are in a much better position to **reason** about the overall benefit of not only each sales method compared to each other, but also the resulting *\"wage\"* compared to other *\"jobs.\"*"
