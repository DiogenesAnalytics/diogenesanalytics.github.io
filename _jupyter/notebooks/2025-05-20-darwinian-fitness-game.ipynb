    "## Introduction\n",
    "From [Conway’s elegant Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) to [Hasbro’s symbolic board game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_of_Life), \"life\" has long been the subject of abstract simulation. In this article we proposes a new game, **Survival of the Fittest**, grounded not in entertainment or [cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton), but in the biological imperatives that shape all living systems: survival and reproduction."

    "At a minimum, every living system depends on a combination of critical inputs - energy, water, shelter, safety, and, eventually, access to mates. These needs are not arbitrary; they reflect universal *needs* that any organism must navigate in order to persist in its environment.\n",

This leads us to a powerful mathematical abstraction: representing fitness as a [utility vector](https://diogenesanalytics.com/blog/2025/04/20/defining-advantage#multiple-option-types), with each dimension capturing the current utility *earned* by securing a specific resource or advantage critical to survival and reproduction:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of structure imposes a universal scaffolding on all players in the game: **before you can play for higher-order fitness, you must win the lower levels first**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means not every policy $\\pi$ is valid: only those that **respect the prerequisite relationships** encoded in the dependency graph are admissible.\n",

    "* The goal is still to **maximize the total fitness utility** $U_f$. That hasn’t changed.\n",

    "* The components of the fitness vector $F$ are not all equally accessible at all times.\n",
    "  <br><br>\n",
    "* **Some utilities are conditional on others** — you can’t pursue higher-order gains until foundational needs are met.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The \"Survival of the Fittest\" is not a chaotic scramble for resources, but a highly structured optimization problem. Organisms aren't just maximizing fitness in the abstract — they are doing so under real, biological constraints shaped by interdependent needs. By formalizing fitness as a utility vector and representing dependencies between needs as a directed acyclic graph, we reveal a deeper logic to evolutionary strategy:"

It unites psychological theory (Maslow), evolutionary biology (fitness landscapes), and game theory (policy optimization) into a single mathematical perspective.

If we can model how needs depend on each other (as Maslow’s hierarchy suggests), we may be able to simulate how organisms and agents intelligently adapt, survive, and make decisions in complex environments."
