    "## Introduction\n",
    "From [Conway’s elegant Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) to [Hasbro’s symbolic board game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_of_Life), \"life\" has long been the subject of abstract simulation. In this article we proposes a new game, **Survival of the Fittest**, grounded not in entertainment or [cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton), but in the biological imperatives that shape all living systems: survival and reproduction."

    "## The Cost of Living\n",
    "To model the game of life, we must first ask: What do organisms need in order to survive, thrive, and reproduce? What resources do they pursue, and how do these shape their behaviors?\n",
    "\n",
    "At a minimum, every living system depends on a combination of critical inputs - energy, water, shelter, safety, and, eventually, access to mates. These needs are not arbitrary; they reflect universal constraints that any organism must navigate in order to persist in its environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "These survival requirements are not reducible to a single objective. Rather:"

    "## Fitness Defined\n",
    "In our Survival of the Fittest game, this motivates a more expressive and flexible formalism: fitness as a multi-dimensional vector, where each dimension tracks how well an organism is doing in a particular domain relevant to survival or reproduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads us to a powerful mathematical abstraction: representing fitness as a [utility vector](https://diogenesanalytics.com/blog/2025/04/20/defining-advantage#multiple-option-types), with each dimension capturing the value gained by securing a specific resource or advantage critical to survival and reproduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{F} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "u_1 \\\\\n",
    "u_2 \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots \\\\\n",
    "u_n\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where each component $u_i$ corresponds to the utility gained from a particular resource or advantage critical to survival and reproduction. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Quantity of energy reserves (from food)\n",
    "* Access to water\n",
    "* Quality of shelter\n",
    "* Size and control of territory\n",
    "* Mating opportunities and success\n",
    "* etc ...\n",
    "\n",
    "The **overall fitness** is often modeled as the weighted sum of these utilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Fitness} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \\, u_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where weights $w_i \\geq 0$ represent the relative importance of each utility dimension in the organism’s environment and evolutionary context.\n",
    "\n",
    "This formalism allows us to capture the trade-offs and priorities organisms must balance: maximizing one utility may reduce another, reflecting the complex strategies needed for survival and reproduction."
