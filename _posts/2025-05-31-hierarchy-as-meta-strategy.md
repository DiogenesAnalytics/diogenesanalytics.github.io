## Introduction
In our [previous article](https://diogenesanalytics.com/blog/2025/05/28/hierarchies-defined), we re-imagined hierarchies not as structures of domination or authority, but as **structures of access**: cumulative, threshold-based systems that expand the set of options. Each level of the hierarchy unlocked new possibilities without revoking the old, forming a scaffold for growth, capability, and decision-making.

But this raises a deeper question:

> What do hierarchies *do* once they are adopted? How do they shape thought, action, and behavior in practice?

In this article, we explore that question, and in doing so, we uncover a more general principle:

> A hierarchy, once adopted, functions as a meta-strategy.

That is, it operates not as a direct strategy itself, but as a **higher-order constraint**: a filter over the space of all possible strategies, selecting only those that conform to the structure of access defined by the hierarchy.

This leads us to the broader topic at the heart of this article: the concept of **meta-strategy**.

In the sections that follow, we define what a meta-strategy is, showing how a hierarchy is simply a *type* of meta-strategy.

## Defining Meta-Strategy
Let $\Pi$ represent the **strategy space**: the full set of possible strategies an agent might follow in a given domain.

A **meta-strategy** $M$ is a higher-order constraint or function acting on $\Pi$, producing a subset $\Pi_M \subseteq \Pi$ that represents the *valid* or *preferred* strategies under that meta-constraint:

$$
M: \Pi \to \mathcal{P}(\Pi), \quad \text{with} \quad \Pi_M = M(\Pi)
$$

Here, $\mathcal{P}(\Pi)$ denotes the **power set** of $\Pi$: the set of *all possible subsets* of the strategy space. This means a meta-strategy does not output a single strategy — it selects a **subset** of strategies that are permissible, plausible, or desirable under its constraints.

In simple terms, a meta-strategy does not directly choose an action — it **shapes the space** in which choices can occur. It filters.

This concept shows up across domains:
* In **meta-reinforcement learning**, meta-policies shape the evolution of lower-level policies.
  <br><br>
* In **cognitive science**, heuristics and learning biases can be modeled as meta-strategies over mental operations.
  <br><br>
* In **governance**, constitutions and laws act as meta-strategies for collective decision-making systems.

## Hierarchy as a Meta-Strategy
One clear and structured example of a meta-strategy is a **hierarchy**.

As described in our [earlier work](https://diogenesanalytics.com/blog/2025/05/28/hierarchies-defined), a hierarchy is not a ladder of power, but a **structure of access**: a series of thresholds, each expanding the available set of options.

When adopted, a hierarchy \$H\$ acts as a meta-strategy \$M\_H\$, filtering the global strategy space $\Pi$ down to only those strategies that respect its layered, cumulative constraints:

$$
\Pi_H = M_H(\Pi) = \{ \pi \in \Pi \mid \pi \text{ conforms to } H \}
$$

That is:

> When applied, a hierarchy acts as a meta-strategy.

This mirrors design patterns in software architecture: an **abstract class** defines a structural framework without dictating implementation — it tells you *what must be there*, not *how* it must work.

In the same way, a hierarchy shapes strategy without specifying every detail. It is not a script, but a scaffold.

## Moral
The central insight is this: **meta-strategies constrain the space of possible strategies.** Rather than specifying particular actions, they define the *conditions* under which strategies are considered valid or permissible.

Hierarchies exemplify this principle. When adopted, a hierarchy does not prescribe actions directly. Instead, it functions as a **meta-strategy** — a higher-order constraint that filters the global strategy space \$\Pi\$ to a subset \$\Pi\_H\$ that aligns with its structure of access.

This perspective shifts our understanding of hierarchies — and meta-strategies more broadly — from static frameworks to active filters that shape decision-making. A meta-strategy structures *how* strategy selection occurs, thus influencing not only outcomes but the very space of possible moves.

Understanding this helps clarify how systems, policies, heuristics, and even values operate at a higher level: by governing the strategic landscape itself.
